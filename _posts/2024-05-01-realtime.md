### Context

- The Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) has brought innovation to reliable image generation. Nevertheless, the inherently slow sampling process of diffusion models hinders real-time generation, negatively impacting user experience.
- Efforts to accelerate LDM generally fall into two categories:
  1. Utilizing advanced ODE solvers such as DDIM and DPMSolver, which drastically reduce the $1,000$ time steps of DDPM.
  2. Distilling LDM.

### Problem

- The slow generation speed of traditional LDMs makes it challenging to satisfy user experience.
- Deploying a site to test user satisfaction requires significant time and resources.

### Proposed Method

- Introducing LCM-LoRA into LDM ([SDXL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952)) to enable near real-time image synthesis:
  - The recently introduced Latent [Consistency Model (LCM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04378), inspired by the [Consistency Model (CM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01469), allows for the application of CM in latent space.
    - It can create an origin from any point on the ODE path.
    - This enables efficient synthesis of high-resolution images with as few as $1$ to $4$ time steps.
  - LCM-LoRA acts as an adapter that can be attached to existing LDMs, reducing training costs.
- Building a website using Flask and ChatGPT.


### Result

- As demonstrated in the demo video on [Github](https://github.com/qkrwnstj306/Text-to-Image-Toy-Project/), the model generates images in response to user text input in near real-time.
- Although not perfectly real-time due to communication delays between the server and user and the time required to save images, the experience is significantly faster and more satisfying than before.
  - Feedback was collected from acquaintances to evaluate user satisfaction.
